        <p class="tagline">Hello World! I'm a computer science student currently finishing my last semester at the University of Manitoba. I've got real world experience in mobile app development and I'm also exploring front end and cross platform mobile development. I love any chance I get to learn something new, and am actively seeking opportunities in the Winnipeg area!</p>

            <h3>&ldquo;ANALOG - The Film Photographer's Toolkit&rdquo;</h3>
                <p><strong>ANALOG</strong> is an Android app made for film photographers. It has three tools to help make the work of photography easier: a logbook, light meter, and depth of field calculator. This app was developed from the ground up completely by me, from the visual design to the actual implementation. You can find it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlacaba.analog&hl=en" target ="_blank" title="ANALOG App">here</a> on Google Play.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><b>Depth of Field Calculator</b></dt>
                    <dd>The depth of field calculator tells you what portion of your photo is in focus, given certain settings. Your depth of field is determined by four things: aperture (size of the lens opening), the size of your film, the focal length of your lens, and the distance of your focus.</dd>

                    <dt><b>Light Meter</b></dt>
                    <dd>The light meter uses your phoneâ€™s front facing light sensor to take a measurement of the ambient light around you. It will use this measurement to calculate the proper camera settings for a good exposure that is neither too bright nor too dark. After taking a measurement, you can directly save the settings to an existing roll of film, or create a new one and s ave it to that!</dd>

                    <dt><b>Logbook</b></dt>
                    <dd>The logbook lets you record information about each roll of film and photo you shoot. You can add and edit things such as: ISO, shutter speed, aperture, film name, photo title, and notes.</dd>

            <h3>&ldquo;Movie Revenue Prediction&rdquo;</h3>
                <p><strong>Movie Revenue Prediction</strong> is a group project for COMP4710: Intro to Data Mining. The group and I attempted to use decision tree classification algorithms to predict the revenue bracket for a movie. We used the following as indicators for predicting the revenue: genre, release date, budget, and production company. I wrote the initial code to read in our database and clean up the data. In particular, my code did the following: correct money values for inflation, classify movies in brackets, parse genre and company from JSON format strings, and output a .csv file with only the relevant parameters.</p>
                <p>My other contribution was implementing the ID3 decision tree algorithm. The decision tree has a 54% accuracy for correctly classifying movies into revenue brackets. There are further modifications that can be made to the tree, outside the scope of our project, that could increase its accuracy. You can find the finished report <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fe7qBX-Spa0mvTgfczcl7nWuw2TRzksY" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>&ldquo;Polyhedron Drawing&rdquo;</h3>
                <p><strong>Polyhedron Drawing</strong> was a course project for COMP4420: Advanced Design and Analysis of Algorithms. The purpose was to read a text file that detailed the vertices and coordinates of a polyhedron, translate the coordinates to the screen, and use the painter's algorithm to display it. In addition to displaying, you can also interact with the polyhedron by rotating, zooming, and changing the colour. This project was developed in Java, using the JOGL Library.</p>
